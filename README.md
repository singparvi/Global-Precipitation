## Regression Based Prediction for Precipitation using Global Climate Data
# This project was to use Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Machine Learning models on Global Climate Data from NASA to make precipitation prediction.

Abstract
Climate is becoming increasingly unpredictable over decades and it has never been more critical to make a better prediction on climate in human history. There is a substantial human and capital cost involved with a severe climate event. Current meteorological models can predict the climate in any area of the world with great accuracy. This research aims at predicting Precipitation using historical information and leveraging Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) in python Machine Learning to make a prediction. The prediction does not have to be for the following week or month, but it can be many years in the future. Multiple models were run using weather data from NASA and at best, an R^2 of 48.5% was obtained. The R^2 value may seem low but the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) has a 67% improvement from the baseline. The low R^2 was attributed to the non-availability of crucial climate information that could be added later to make a more refined prediction. Temperature was identified as the key feature in predicting Precipitation. This research’s best model’s predictions may enable decision-makers like governments or even insurance companies (with financial interests) to make predictions to plan for policies or undertaken risks.
